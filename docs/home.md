Project Scenario: Optimizing Wind Operations for EnergyCo's Wind Business Unit

Background: EnergyCo, a well-established energy company, operates multiple business units, including wind energy. Their Wind Operations Business Unit manages a portfolio of wind farms. While they have achieved success in the wind energy sector, EnergyCo believes that advancements in technology and data analytics can further optimize their wind farm operations. Their goal is to maximize energy generation, minimize operational costs, and ensure compliance with environmental standards and grid requirements specifically within their wind energy business.

Project Objective: Students will embark on a project to assess EnergyCo's wind farm operations within the Wind Operations Business Unit and identify opportunities for improvement. They will leverage data transformation, analytics, and optimization techniques to address the central question: Can EnergyCo's wind operations be made more optimal?

Key Components:
•	Existing Data: Students will have access to historical data related to wind farm performance, turbine operations, maintenance records, and other relevant information. This data represents EnergyCo's wind operations business unit's current activities.
•	Technology Integration: Students will explore the integration of advanced technology and data analytics to enhance wind farm operations within the Wind Business Unit. This could encompass predictive maintenance, real-time data analysis, weather forecasting, and other relevant innovations.
•	Optimization Goals: Students will define specific optimization goals, such as improving energy production, reducing operational expenses, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations, and enhancing grid integration, all within the context of EnergyCo's wind energy sector.
•	Collaboration: Teams will collaborate to develop a data-driven solution that addresses specific aspects of optimizing wind farm operations for EnergyCo's Wind Business Unit.

Course Focus: Throughout the course, students will work on different facets of the optimization project, gradually incorporating new technology and data analytics to make EnergyCo's wind farm operations within the Wind Business Unit more efficient and sustainable. They will document their architectural decisions and design rationale (ARDs) each week to ensure transparency and promote learning from the project's progression.
